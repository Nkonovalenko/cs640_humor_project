# cs640_humor_project
Our project code is organized into 3 directories:
 - Code
 This contains our python code for the project. We parse our input files, form them into prompts, and then make queries to GPT-3. In order to run the code, you must create a "secret.py" file containing your GPT-3 API Secret Key. The file was not uploaded to github for security reasons.
 - Data
 This contains our input data files.
 - Results
 This contains some samples of the results of using these files.
